    - add- function to add one unit of an item from cart
    - removeAll- function to remove all units of an item from the cart
    - removeOne- function to remove one unit of an item from cart
  - all items in the index.js items array will be mapped to a function creating
    a cart card, with various controls that call functions from index.js

How Data is Passed Through Components
- all necessary items/functions are passed as props
- the menuList, containing all items, is passed to the FilteredList
  - this is filtered and passed to the DisplayList
- the cart receives the items array, which contains all the arrays needed to be
  displayed in the cart
- most important functions are contained within index.js and called from within
  components, passed as props

Triggering State Changes
- select a filter/sort option
  - this changes the filter/sort state, as well as the color of the links to indicate
    the selected option
  - the displayed items change as a result of the state change
- add item to cart- clicking the "Add to Cart" button will call the add function
  within index.js and add the item to the cart array, or increment the quantity
- Cart.js
  - add/remove- user can increment the number of units in the cart
    - remove is disabled if there is only one item
  - removeAll will remove an item from the cart array completely
  - user can clear the cart completely and remove all items
